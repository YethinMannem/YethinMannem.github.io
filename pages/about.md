# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am currently pursuing my Masters at North Dakota State University. I worked as a Software Engineer with a passion for solving problems in real world and I enjoy the brainstorming and collaboration to bring ideas into reality. Having worked on problems at scale I am experienced in delivering high quality software and robust systems.

Apart from work I enjoy working out and sometimes learning music. I also keep exploring things related to entrepreneurship and finance. If you liked my profile, feel free to reach out to me happy to connect!
